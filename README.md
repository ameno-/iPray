iPray
=====

_A web app for helping Muslims determine what time prayers come in_

#Why is iPray different?
- Prayer times are calculated on the fly using Pray.js
- Does not need internet access to calculate prayer times
- Instead of a simple readout of what time the prayer is, iPray returns a _countdown_ to when the prayer occurs
- Simple UI
