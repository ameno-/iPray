iPray
=====

A web app for helping Muslims determine what time prayers come in. Instead of pulling prayer times from online database, iPray calculates prayer times on the fly using a suer's location data. With iPray, you don't need an active internet connection to determine the correct prayer time. 

#Why is iPray different?
- Prayer times are calculated on the fly using Pray.js
- Does not need internet access to calculate prayer times
- Instead of a simple readout of what time the prayer is, iPray returns a _countdown_ to when the prayer occurs

#ToDo
- Add the 'upcoming times' for slide
- Re-vamp UI to feel more like an app. Options for settings, customizations, languages, and different countdown formats
- Add refresh button so users can request new countdowns
- Create coachmarks to help orient users.
